# Flingshot

What is it?
-----------

Flingshot uses Phaser, a phsyics engine, to simulate a game where you can hit students from the back of classroom. The game is sparked from our childhood imagination to tease other students in our class. Never attempted in real life, we created this game to fulfill your fantasy without getting yourself suspended.

Users can drag anywhere from the screen to shoot paper balls at only students who raise their hands. Users get 10 points for hitting the right student, and lose 5 points for hitting the wrong one.
